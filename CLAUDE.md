## Project Memories

- I am building a Lab Streaming Layer package for node.
- We need create a completely new node-lsl package with updated dependences, syntex, and new lsl release inside node-lsl folder. The naming convention should follow javascript, typescript. For example in python it is push_sample, in JavaScript it should be pushSample.

- The number of inputs, in node-lsl should be the same as the python functions.

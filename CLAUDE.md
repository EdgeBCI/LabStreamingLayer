## Project Memories

- I am building a Lab Streaming Layer package for node. There is a repository from 8 years ago build by a developer and the code is not clean. I need to completely refactor it to most recent node version and dependences.
- The old node lsl package is located in the nolde-lsl-old folder, and everything is completely out of date. It is created by a random developer 8 years ago. We need create a completely new node-lsl package with updated dependences, syntex, and new lsl release inside node-lsl folder.

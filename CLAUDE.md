## Project Memories

- I am building a Lab Streaming Layer package for node from scratch.
- We need create a new node-lsl package inside node-lsl folder. The Function and Parameter naming convention should follow javascript, typescript. For example in python it is push_sample, in JavaScript it should be pushSample.

- The number of inputs to functions in node-lsl should be the same as the pylsl functions. The behavior of the node-lsl should be very similar as the pylsl. I also downloaded pylsl source  code and put inside the folder.

- Should use ES Modules (ESM). Modern, standard JS syntax for modules in browsers and Node.
